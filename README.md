## 📅 Daily Progress

Each folder (e.g., `Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc.) contains the code and projects I’ve completed for that specific day in the course. I’m following the structure and instructions provided, and uploading only that day’s project.

📌 **Routine:**  
I upload one project each day to stay consistent and focused.

## 🔥 Goal

To become highly proficient in Python and build a strong portfolio through consistent, hands-on practice.
